# Mass-Spectrometry-Images-CNN-AI-Analysis
Using Python, implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) AI to automate the analysis of thousands of lab-produced images that otherwise are being analyzed by hand. This program seeks to unburden academic biologists of wasting time that could otherwise be spend researching in their field of expertise.
